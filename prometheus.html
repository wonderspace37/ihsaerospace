        <p class="prom_paras">In the rapidly evolving world of space technology, agility, collaboration, and innovation are key. Prometheus-A embodies these principles, paving the way for groundbreaking space-based research while opening the door for others to ride alongside through our dedicated rideshare initiative, OrbitShare.</p>
        <h2>What is Prometheus-Alpha?</h2>
        <div class="blog_break">
          <img class="prom_images"  src="mock_prometheus.png">
            <p class="prom_paras">Prometheus-A is a multi-mission CubeSat platform designed to democratize access to low Earth orbit (LEO) through a reliable and modular rideshare system. Originally conceptualized as AetherSat, the mission has expanded in scope and ambition, now housing both internal research payloads and guest CubeSat modules through OrbitShare.</p>
            <p class="prom_paras">At the core of Prometheus-A is RAD-OES (Radio and Optical Environmental Surveyor), a pioneering science payload aimed at understanding the relationship between solar activity and radio frequency interference on Earth and in near-space environments.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Inside RAD-OES</h2>
        <div class="blog_break">
          <img class="prom_images"  src="prom_image_mock.png">
          <p class="prom_paras">Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) emit high-energy particles that can severely disrupt radio communications, GPS, and satellite operations. RAD-OES aims to correlate real-time solar activity with fluctuations in RF environments, offering a clearer picture of how space weather affects global infrastructure.</p>
