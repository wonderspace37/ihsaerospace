            <p class="prom_paras">After months of preparation, simulations, and field testing, our team qualified for the National Rocketry Competition. This post details our experience from concept design to final launch day. We faced several challenges, including flight instability and unexpected weather, but ultimately succeeded with a flight that reached over 2,000 feet.</p>
            <p class="prom_paras" >We’re incredibly proud of how far our propulsion and avionics systems have come. Through collaboration and persistence, we overcame all odds. Stay tuned for a technical breakdown and video recap in next week's post!</p>
